# flex-able
Do browsers dream of flexed sheeps?

## What is it?
This package sets every layout tag (div, section, etc...) to
```
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
```

Please don't use this on production environments, unless you really know what to do.

## Usage
```
npm install @8lall0/flex-able
```
This package provides:
* a single css file for quick import
* a scss file for including this inside your sass project

## Why flex-able?
This package's name is inspired by the [first Steve Vai' solo album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex-Able). Check it out, it's a nice one.

## Is this a troll package?
Yes and no.

I obviously want to troll the horrible habit of npm packages to be ridiculously small, useless and... just something that you can do by yourself (eg. the infamous [isOdd](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-odd)).

But also i really want to try how this modification can affect a normal workflow. I think that can be a nice experiment.
